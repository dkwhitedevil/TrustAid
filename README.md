# 🌍 TrustAid – AI + Blockchain‑Verified Donation Platform

*TrustAid* is an end‑to‑end donation platform that makes every rupee traceable. By fusing *AI verification* (OCR + face matching + receipt analysis) with *Algorand smart contracts*, it gives donors cryptographic proof that their money helped real people.

## 🏗 Tech Stack

| Layer      | Tech / Service                               |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend   | React + Tailwind CSS (built on Bolt.new)     |
| Backend    | Supabase (Postgres DB + Auth + Storage)      |
| AI Engine  | Python (DeepFace, Tesseract / Google Vision) |
| Blockchain | Algorand (TestNet) + PyTeal + Pera Wallet    |
| DevOps     | Netlify (CI/CD) • IONOS Domain via Entri     |

## 🔁 Workflow — How It Works

1. *Beneficiary* uploads ID + selfie → AI verifies identity.
2. Submits aid request → moves to *NGO* queue.
3. *NGO* approves and later uploads photo + receipt → AI checks proof.
4. Request marked *verified* → visible to *Donor*.
5. *Donor* funds via Pera Wallet → PyTeal escrow holds & releases funds.
6. Donor sees proof, AI scores, and on‑chain Tx hash — total transparency.
